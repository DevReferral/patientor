**What to do when you dive into an old project at a company or an open-source project ?**

1. Start your research by reading the `README.md` in the root of the repository.
2. Take a peek at the `package.json`.
3. Try looking for `types.ts` or something similar to get started.
4. Browse the folder structure to get some insight into the application's functionality and/or the architecture used.
5. If the project has unit, integration or end-to-end tests, reading those is most likely beneficial.
6. Start the application and click around to verify you have a functional development environment.
